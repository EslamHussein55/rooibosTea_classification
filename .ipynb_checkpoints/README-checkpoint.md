# rooibosTea_classification
An educational tutorial that is based on rooibos tea data. The tutorials run through data visualization, data correlation, and finally performing binary classification on fermented and non-fermented rooibos data using basic statistical methods and some machine learning tools. The work is fairly simple, and can work on ***Google Colab!** (https://colab.research.google.com/)

### This repo has four notebooks (/rooibos/..):
1. Tutorial 1: Data visualization
2. Tutorial 2: Data correlation
3. Tutorial 3: Classification using simple statistics
4. Tutorial 3: Classification using simple statistics
