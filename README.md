# rooibosTea_classification
An educational tutorial that is based on rooibos tea data. The tutorials run through data visualization, data correlation, and finally performing binary classification on fermented and non-fermented rooibos data using basic statistical methods and some machine learning tools. The work is fairly simple, and can work on ***Google Colab!** (https://colab.research.google.com/)

### This repo has three notebooks:
1. data visualization
2. data correlation
3. stats_classification
4. ml_classification
