    "\n",
    "- A statistical method which is often used to determine the degree of linear dependency between pairs of variables. \n",
    "- The dependency is expressed using a single number (the _correlation coefficient_) which is between -1 and 1. We can say that two variables are negatively correlated, positively correlated, or uncorrelated according to whether the correlation coefficient is negative, positive, or 0.\n",
    "- Two variables are strongly correlated if a scatter plot of the variables has points which lie nearly along a line. On the other hand, variables are uncorrelated is the scatter plot shows a \"cloud\" of points that has no slant tendency.\n",

    "\n",
    "The p value has the following meaning (one must be very careful about this, because the p value is often misunderstood). Suppose the estimated correlation coefficient is C. In this case, the p value is the conditional probability given that the correlation coefficient is 0 that the measured correlation coefficient will have absolute value greater than or equal to C. In other words, the p value is the probability given that  𝐻0  is true that a measurement that is \"at least as extreme\" as C is obtained. So it is not true that \"the p value is the probability that H0 is false\", because it is calculated under the assumption that H0 is true! Instead, the p value expresses a likelihood. For example, suppose my friend flips a coin 20 times and get 20 heads. If the coin is actually fair, the probability this would happens is less than 0.00001. So it is likely that the coin is not fair (e.g. maybe it has 'head' on both sides). But it is not correct to say that the probability that the coin is fair is 0.00001.\n",

    "If the p value is below a certain level, then we reject the null hypothesis. The level of rejection is called the confidence level. What significance level you use depends on the application. In many cases, a confidence level of 0.01 is used.\n",

    "The results show there is a statistically significant positive correlation between TPC and TEAC for fermented (blue). This is reflected in the tilted orientation of the ellipse. On the other hand, the correlation between TPC and TEAC for unfermented is not statistically signficant (p > 0.01). \n",
    "\n",
    "The graph also shows a large overlap between the fermented and nonfermented data. Both confidence ellipses contain many points with $225 < TPC < 300$ and $2000 < TEAC < 2500$. Because of the correlation, fermented data with lower values of TPC also tend to have lower values of TEAC. The relative sizes of the ellipses shows that nonfermented data is more spead out, meaning a wider range of values is observed (particularly with TPC).  "
