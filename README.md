# Rooibos tea classification 

## Description

Welcome to the project on rooibos tea classification ! From the tutorials you will learn to do the following:

- *Tutorial 1*: Data visualization
- *Tutorial 2*: Data correlation
- *Tutorial 3*: Classification using simple statistics
- *Tutorial 4*: Classification using machine learning


## Data
98 randomly selected fermented (fer) (51 samples) and nonfermnted (nf) (47 samples) were kindlydonated by Rooibos LTD-BPK (Clanwilliam, South Africa) during March 2020. 


## Hackathon Task
From the proposed pipeline (tutorials), investigate new ways to classify between fer and nf rooibos tea


## Prerequisites

All the libraries/dependencies necessary to run the tutorials are listed in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Hack4Dev/rooibosTea_classification/blob/main/requirements.txt) file.


## Installation

All the required libraries can be installed using pip and the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Hack4Dev/rooibosTea_classification/blob/main/requirements.txt) file in the repo:

```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Would you like to clone this repository? Feel free!

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/Hack4Dev/rooibosTea_classification.git
```

Then make sure you have the right Python libraries for the tutorials. 


### New to Github?

The easiest way to get all of the lecture and tutorial material is to clone this repository. To do this you need git installed on your laptop. If you're working on Linux you can install git using apt-get (you might need to use sudo):
